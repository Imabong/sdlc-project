# Hostel Room Checker System

## Description
The Hostel Room Checker System is a simple Python-based application that allows students to check their hostel room allocation using only their matric number.

## Features
- Simple matric number input
- Fast room allocation check
- Beginner-friendly Python code
- SDLC-based system design

##  Scope of the Project
This system covers only hostel room checking. It does not handle hostel payments, room booking, or student registration.


##  SDLC Model Used
The project follows the SDLC model:
1. Planning  
2. Requirement Analysis  
3. System Design  
4. Implementation  
5. Testing  
6. Deployment  
7. Maintenance  

##  Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Code Editor: VS Code / Any text editor
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

##  How the System Works
1. The user runs the program
2. The system requests the matric number
3. The system checks the matric number in the stored records
4. If found, the hostel room is displayed
5. If not found, “Not Allocated” is displayed


## How to Run the Program
1. Install Python (version 3 or higher)
2. Open the project folder
3. Navigate to the `src` folder
4. Run the program using the command:
     sdlcproject.py

## Conclusion
The Hostel Room Checker System is a simple and efficient application that demonstrates the use of SDLC in solving real-life problems using Python.
